What Is This?

This mod adds the ability to split items by a specific amount by holding down left CTRL + right clicking.

The vanilla right-click split 50% mechanic is unchanged. To specify the quantity to split by, hold Control when you right click.

Installation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod must be installed on both server and client.
